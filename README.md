## Installation
For running the search engine, first install gradle 6.5.1 for Windows from this page - [https://gradle.org/releases/](https://gradle.org/releases/)

Make sure gradle is in the PATH environment variable of the system. 

Then from the root folder of the project i.e. `Search-Engine`, run `gradle run`.
This should start the server on `http://localhost:8000/`, port 8000.
Now start the client from the client project.
